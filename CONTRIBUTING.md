## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Code

- Use ES modules (import/export)
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Document public functions with JSDoc
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use descriptive names for variables and functions
- Leverage TypeScript types - avoid `any`

### Commits

Use clear and descriptive commit messages:

```
feat: add JPEG format support
fix: correct logo rendering error
docs: update examples in README
refactor: reorganize rendering modules
test: add tests for option validation
```

├── lib/
│   ├── QRGenerator.ts         # Main class
│   ├── renderers/             # Specialized modules
│   └── utils/                 # Utilities and helpers

```

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build project: `npm run build`
4. Run examples: `npm run example:basic`
5. Test CLI: `npm run dev -- --url "test"`

## Development Workflow

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles TypeScript files from `src/` to `dist/`.

### Testing Changes

```bash
# Test CLI in development mode
npm run dev -- --url "https://example.com" --gradient

# Test programmatic usage
npm run example:programmatic
```

### Code Quality

- Write clean, readable code
- Add TypeScript types for all parameters and return values
- Document complex logic with comments
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
